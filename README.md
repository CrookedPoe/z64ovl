# z64ovl
z64ovl, or [**z**]elda[**64**][**ov**]er[**l**]ay is a collection or C header files and linker scripts that make compiling overlays targeted towards Zelda on the Nintendo 64 easy for anyone to do. This project was started in 2017 as a collaboration between me, CrookedPoe and z64me, and has since been contributed by many members of the N64 modding community.

# CrookedPoe's Fork
This repository is a fork of the original [repository](https://github.com/z64me/z64ovl) with the intention to be more or less a complete rewrite, putting a preimum on consistent, clean, and readable code that makes it easy for the average amateur coder, or even those who haven't had any previous programming experience easy to grasp and learn effectively.

# Installing z64ovl
This particular fork is not ready for immediate use and has not been tested thus far. It is still in development, and should you want to use z64ovl it would be best to start with the original [repository](https://github.com/z64me/z64ovl) using its installation [guide](http://www.z64.me/guides/overlay-environment-setup-windows). Admittedly, it's a little bit outdated, and a new and easy installation guide will be written once this is ready for release.
